# üß† Brain Tumor Classification with k-NN and Decision Tree

This project classifies brain tumors using MRI images and two machine learning algorithms: **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** and **Decision Tree**. It involves preprocessing image data, training models, and evaluating performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**:  
   - Resize images to `244x244` using OpenCV  
   - Flatten and label images

2. **Model Training**:  
   - k-NN: Tested with `k = 3, 5, 7, 9, 11`  
   - Decision Tree: Used `max_depth` variations  

3. **Evaluation**:  
   - Confusion matrix per class (one-vs-all)  
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Visualized using Seaborn heatmaps
